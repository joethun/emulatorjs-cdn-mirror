## Usage

Depending on which version you would like to use, set your EJS_pathtodata to one of the following:

- **Nightly**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joethun/emulatorjs-cdn-mirror@main/nightly/`
- **Stable**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joethun/emulatorjs-cdn-mirror@main/stable/`

Keep in mind that the nightly builds of EmulatorJS are somewhat experimental and might have bugs.
